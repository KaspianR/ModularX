# ModularX
*ModularX* (because I already used the name *Modular* for something different) is a Discord bot that allows you to create your own custom commands instead of using only the ones made by the bots creator. It uses a custom-built programming language that is then executed by the bot which is running on  Node.JS. The custom language is similar to *Basic* but has been designed to work with Discord and has some unique functions that help with this.

## This repository
I don't plan to make this an open-source project so the bots actual code will be kept on a private branch. This repository will just contain a wiki and all the commands the bot can execute so that you can see them for yourself.

## Current status
This is still a work in progress. I will continue to update this repository (and especially the wiki) as I work more on the bot but right now it is not public and it is also far from complete.
